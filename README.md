### Introduction

This tool takes a 3d mesh as input and compresses it into another 3d mesh such that the outputed mesh will use much less triangles while keeps the shape of the original mesh. The algorithm is based on metric-driven Discrete Voronoi Diagram construction. Some code is from other open source projects. This project is originally what I did for the (free-topic group) final project for CS184 at UC Berkeley, but I only open-sourced the part that I implemented in this repository, which includes `vertexClustering.cpp` (the implementation of metric-driven Voronoi Diagram based remeshing) and `VCFrontEnd.cpp` (a simply parser for parsing the command line arguments).

My implementation is mainly based on [1]. I implemented uniform remeshing, adaptive remeshing, anisotropic remeshing, and an optimal vertex placement policy based on the Quadric Error Metrics described in that paper. The main idea of this approach is to group the triangles of the input mesh into clusters, and the compute a representative vertex for each cluster, and finally connect these new vertices together to form a new mesh.

For more information, please checkout the "Remeshing" section in the original 
[final project report](https://184meshproj.weebly.com/).
